  "aboutme":"I earned a B.A. in mathematics from the University of Florida in 2017. During that time, I knew that I wanted to apply these skills to something interesting where I could find creative solutions to real problems. After doing extensive research, I realized that a transition to the technology ecosystem was the best move to expand my mathematical background and apply it to an area that will fulfill those goals. I decided to join Wyncode, and in ten weeks, I learned the fundamentals of full stack web development, creating projects in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and a full stack final project using Ruby on Rails.",
